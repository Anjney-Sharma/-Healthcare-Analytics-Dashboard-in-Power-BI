## ‚ú® Key Features
- Dynamic KPI Cards: At-a-glance view of critical metrics, including total waiting patients and comparisons between current and previous year data.

- Historical Trend Analysis: A line chart visualizing monthly waiting list trends for both inpatient and outpatient cases.

- Demographic & Specialty Breakdown: In-depth analysis of patient age profiles and performance across different medical specialties.

- Interactive Filtering: User-friendly slicers allow filtering the entire report by case type, specialty group, and date range.

- Custom Tooltips: Hovering over visuals reveals detailed drill-down information, providing deeper context without leaving the summary page.

### Two-Page Report Design:

1. Summary Page: A high-level overview of all key performance indicators.

2. Detailed View: A granular, table-level view for in-depth analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Methodology
This dashboard was built following a structured 9-step process, ensuring a robust and user-centric final product:

1. Requirement Gathering: Identifying stakeholders and defining business objectives, scope, and key metrics.

2. Data Collection: Importing and consolidating data from multiple Excel files.

3. Data Transformation & Modeling: Cleaning, shaping, and modeling the data using Power Query to create a relational model.

4. Data Visualization Blueprint: Planning the layout and design of the dashboard pages.

5. Dashboard Layout & Design: Building the visuals, writing DAX measures, and implementing the planned layout.

6. Dashboard Beautification: Enhancing the UI/UX with custom themes, backgrounds, and formatting.

7. Adding Interactivity: Implementing features like custom tooltips, navigation, and slicer interactions.

8. Testing & Sharing: Implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) and publishing the report to Power BI Service.

9. Maintenance & Refresh: Establishing a process for routine data refreshes.

## üíª Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop: The primary tool for data modeling, analysis, and visualization.

- Power Query (M Language): Used for all data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create complex measures and calculated columns for KPIs.
